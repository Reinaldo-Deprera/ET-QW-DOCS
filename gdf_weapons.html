				<h2>General Weapon Info</h2>
				<p>Your stance affects your weapons accuracy. Crouching (Default C) will reduce your target area and give you better aim, but slows your movement. Going Prone (Default X) will give you the best accuracy of all, and will make you a much smaller target, but it takes time to switch between prone and standing positions, and only allows you to crawl. You’ll get the best accuracy by firing short bursts, or even better, single shots.</P>

				<P>Equipping a heavy weapon slows your run speed. Change to a lighter weapon to run faster.</P>
				<P>Sight view provides better accuracy, but reduced movement speed. You cannot Sprint in Weapon Sight view.</P>
				<br>
				<img src="m/weapons/knife.jpg" class="weapon left" />
				<P><b>Combat Knife</b><BR>
				The GDF’s Combat Knife is issued as a weapon of last resort when all ammunition has been exhausted. Use the Combat Knife for silent melee kills. You'll do extra Backstab damage from behind.</P>
				<br>

				<img src="m/weapons/pistol.jpg" class="weapon left" />
				<P><b>Pistol</b><BR>
				The Pistol is your short-range backup weapon.</P>
				<br>
				<br>
				<br>

				<img src="m/weapons/silenced_pistol.jpg" class="weapon left" />
				<P><b>Silenced Pistol</b><BR>
				The Silenced Pistol is a stealthy short-range killing tool issued to the Covert Ops class.</P>
				<br>
				<br>

				<img src="m/weapons/machine_pistol.jpg" class="weapon left" />
				<P><b>Machine Pistol</b><BR>
				The Machine Pistol is your short-range backup weapon. It is a full-auto only sidearm, maximising rate of fire at the expense of accuracy. The Machine Pistol fires on full-auto only, although experienced players will be able to squeeze off single shots.</P>
				<br>

				<img src="m/weapons/silencedmachine_pistol.jpg" class="weapon left" />
				<P><b>Silenced Machine Pistol</b><BR>
				The Silenced Machine Pistol is an unlockable reward available only to 	experienced Covert Ops. The Silenced Machine Pistol is ineffective at medium or long ranges, but deadly at close range and the lack of give-away muzzle blast may allow a well-concealed Covert Ops to kill several enemies before <img src="m/weapons/black1.jpg" class="black1 left" />being detected.</P>
				<br>

				<img src="m/weapons/assault_rifle.jpg" class="weapon left" />
				<P><b>Assault Rifle</b><BR>
				The Assault Rifle is a good short/medium-range infantry weapon. Fire short bursts for better accuracy. Experienced Engineers can earn the Grenade Launcher attacher upgrade.</P>
				<br>


				<img src="m/weapons/shotgun.jpg" class="weapon left" />
				<P><b>Shotgun</b><BR>
				The Shotgun is ineffective at distance but is deadly at close range, making it an ideal choice for combat inside buildings or dense cover. </P>
				<br>
				<br>

				<img src="m/weapons/gpmg.jpg" class="weapon left" />
				<P><b>GPMG (Heavy Machine Gun)</b><BR>
				The GPMG (General Purpose Machine Gun) is the GDF’s belt-fed infantry support weapon. It is more effective against infantry than vehicles. It's a heavy and bulky weapon, best fired from the prone	position. Reloading involves detaching the heavy ammo box, attaching a new box, and opening the <img src="m/weapons/black1.jpg" class="black1 left" />weapon’s feed cover to attach the new belt into the breech. This takes some time, so try not to reload unless you’re in good cover.</P>
				<br>

				<img src="m/weapons/rocket_launcher.jpg" class="weapon left" />
				<P><b>Rocket Launcher</b><BR>
				It is the GDF’s main light anti-vehicle weapon and is only available to the Soldier. More effective against vehicles and deployables  than infantry, the Rocket Launcher has two modes, Dumb and Smart. In Dumb mode, it fires an unguided rocket, like a bazooka. There is a slight delay before firing, and the <img src="m/weapons/black3.jpg" class="black3 left" />unguided rocket has an arced trajectory, requiring the player to correct their aim depending on the target’s range.</P>

				<P>Hitting Alt-Fire enters Smart Mode, which uses the electronic sight to Lock On to enemy vehicles and deployables. Track the enemy unit until the crosshair turns from green to red and then hit fire. The rocket will then guide itself to the target, without any further need for you to track it. Hit Use to cancel Lock On.
				<br>
				<br>

				<img src="m/weapons/assault_rifle_grenade.jpg" class="weapon left" />
				<p><b>Grenade Launcher</b><BR>
				The Grenade Launcher fires High Explosive grenades in a high arc and is useful for firing over cover, through doorways and windows and is effective against infantry, deployables, and vehicles. The grenades will bounce off surfaces, allowing you to shoot around corners. The arc of the Grenade <img src="m/weapons/black1.jpg" class="black1 left" />Launcher comes in handy to damage deployables from behind cover and from quite a range. Careful you don’t fire from too close, or they may bounce back <img src="m/weapons/black1.jpg" class="black1 left" />at you.</P>
				<br>

				<img src="m/weapons/sniper_rifle.jpg" class="weapon left" />
				<P><b>Sniper Rifle</b><BR>
				The Sniper Rifle is your long-range killing tool. It is a single-shot, bolt-action magazine-fed rifle, which has to be reloaded manually after every shot. The Sniper Rifle has zoomable sights. Press Alt-Fire (Mouse2 default) for Weapon Sight view and then scroll your mousewheel or hit <b>F</b> to cycle through the levels <img src="m/weapons/black1.jpg" class="black1 left" />of zoom magnification. </P>
				<br>

				<img src="m/weapons/scoped_assault_rifle.jpg" class="weapon left" />
				<P><b>Scoped Assault Rifle</b><BR>
				The Scoped Assault Rifle is a sharpshooter variant available only to the GDF Covert Ops and Field Ops. It’s not as accurate as the Sniper Rifle, but has a greater rate of fire.  The Scoped Assault Rifle is a good short/medium-range infantry weapon. In Alt-Fire Weapon Sight mode it will fire only three-round <img src="m/weapons/black1.jpg" class="black1 left" />bursts for better accuracy.</P>
				<br>

				<img src="m/weapons/frag_grenade.jpg" class="weapon left" />
				<P><b>Frag Grenade</b><BR>
				The Frag Grenade is the standard GDF offensive explosive munition. It is effective against Strogg infantry, deployables and vehicles. Keep Fire pressed to throw the Frag Grenade a little further. Hit Alt-Fire to drop the Frag Grenade in front of you.</P>
				<br>

				<img src="m/weapons/emp_grenade.jpg" class="weapon left" />
				<P><b>EMP Grenade</b><BR>
				The EMP Grenade is issued to the GDF Covert Ops class to disable Strogg vehicles and deployables. It is particularly useful for knocking out enemy defence turrets, creating a window of opportunity for attacking players to swarm past without harm.</P>

				<P><img src="m/weapons/black1.jpg" class="black1 left" />Any Strogg vehicles or deployables caught in the blast area will be disabled for 30 seconds. Strogg infantry will suffer some by it.</P>
				<br>

				<img src="m/weapons/smoke_grenade.jpg" class="weapon left" />
				<P><b>Smoke Grenade</b><BR>
				The Smoke Grenade provides concealment for you and your teammates.</P>
