<BR>
<P>-=DIRECTX=-</P>
<P>Enemy Territory: Quake Wars (hereafter ET:QW) requires that your computer have the latest version of DirectX 9.0c installed in order to run.  This is included with ET:QW and will run automatically during installation, and is also available online at:</P>
<P><A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com" TARGET="_blank">http://www.microsoft.com</A></P>
<BR>
<P>-=PUNKBUSTER(TM)=-</P>
<P>During the installation of ET:QW you will be given the option to install Even Balance, Inc.'s PunkBuster anti-cheat system.  This is optional, however if it is not installed you will not be able to play on ranked servers, or servers that have PunkBuster enabled.</P>
<BR>
<P>-=CREATING AN ACCOUNT=-</P>
<P>Upon launching the game after installation you will be prompted to create an account.  Creating an online account requires a username and license code which is located inside the packaging of the game.  An offline account only requires a username, but is limited to LAN and Play Computer mode.</P>
<P>NOTE: You will not be able to retrieve or create an online account without an Internet connection.</P>
<BR>
<P>-=UNINSTALLING=-</P>
<P>ET:QW can be uninstalled from your system from the Add/Remove programs section of the Windows Control Panel (Start -&gt; Settings -&gt; Control Panel).  Select ET:QW from the list of applications installed and select Change/Remove, then follow the instructions on screen.</P>
<BR>
<HR>
<P>III. HOSTING A SERVER</P>
<HR>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>ET:QW comes with a server creation tool allowing you to host an unranked server from your machine.  This will create a 'dedicated' server, that can only be connected to from other machines, not be played on locally.  There is a lite version of the dedicated server that can be downloaded for free separately that doesn't require nearly as much hard drive space as the full game.  This lite server can only be used as an unranked server.</P>
<P>-=RANKED AND UNRANKED SERVERS=-<BR>
Servers can be hosted through two methods: ranked and unranked.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-=Unranked Servers=-<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unranked servers will not track persistent stats, however allow you to host servers from anywhere as well as apply any modifications or server changes that you like.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-=Ranked Servers=-<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ranked servers track persistent stats, cannot be modded, and can only be hosted through an official Game Server Provider (GSP).  Several settings are forced on a ranked server, including but not limited to PunkBuster, friendly fire, and forcing balanced teams.</P>
<P>Please see the server_readme.txt (linked in the ET:QW Start Menu folder) for more thorough information on creating a server.</P>
<BR>
<HR>
<P>IV. TROUBLESHOOTING</P>
<HR>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>-=VIDEO ISSUES=-</P>
<P>Most video issues can be resolved by installing the latest drivers for your video card from the manufacturer's website.</P>
<P>ATI: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://www.ati.com" TARGET="_blank">http://www.ati.com</A><BR>
NVIDIA: <A HREF="http://www.nvidia.com" TARGET="_blank">http://www.nvidia.com</A></P>
<P>PROBLEM: DESKTOP MUST BE SET TO 32 BPP MODE<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you receive this error when attempting to launch ET:QW, you will need to set your desktop to 32 bit color:<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.  Open the Windows Control Panel through Start -&gt; Settings -&gt; Control Panel.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.  Double click the Display icon.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.  Click the Settings Tab.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.  Under Color quality, select 'Highest (32 bit)' and click OK.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once the new settings are applied ET:QW should launch normally.</P>
<P>PROBLEM: SOFT PARTICLES DO NOT WORK ON ATI CARDS</P>
<P>As of the release of ET:QW, the Soft Particles option is unavailable on ATI cards, and will be grayed out in the main menu.</P>
<P>PROBLEM: BRIGHTNESS SLIDER LOSES FUNCTIONALITY IN WINDOWED MODE</P>
<P>The brightness slider in the main menu may lose functionality when exiting fullscreen and entering windowed mode.  Exiting and restarting the game fully will resolve the issue.</P>
<P>PROBLEM: POOR PERFORMANCE WITH DUAL MONITORS<BR>
  <BR>
Some users may occasionally encounter poor performance when using dual monitors on the Nvidia Geforce 8 series of video cards with Dual View enabled.  To resolve this, follow these steps:</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Right click on the desktop.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. In the window that appears, left click the Nvidia Control Panel.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. Once inside of the control panel, click on manage 3D settings.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. Under the Global settings tab, look for the Multi-display\mixed GPU-application.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. Click on the text that says single display performance mode and make sure that it is applied.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<BR>
PROBLEM: ERROR DURING INITIALIZATION WHEN LOADING</P>
<P>If this error is received with messaging that includes &quot;ERROR: The current video card / driver combination does not support the necesary features&quot;, this is likely due to outdated drivers or possibly having the Extension limit enabled in the NVIDIA Control Panel.  To disable this, follow these steps and try re-launching the game:</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Open the NVIDIA Control Panel<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Select 'Manage 3D Settings'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. Find the 'Extension limit' option, and set it to 'Off'.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. Apply the changes and then re-launch the game.</P>
<BR>
<P>-=SOUND ISSUES=-</P>
<P>Most sound issues can be resolved by ensuring you have the latest AC97 drivers for your sound card installed.  Check the website of your sound card manufacturer for the latest AC97 driver release if you are encountering problems with audio playback.</P>
<BR>
<P>-=INTERNET & CONNECTIVITY ISSUES=-</P>
<P>ET:QW requires an active Internet connection for online play.  If you are having problems connecting to a server, make sure your Internet connection is active (try websites, other online games, etc).</P>
<P>If you are having problems hosting a server, please see the Hosting a Server section above in regards to opening ports and NAT traversal.</P>
<P>PROBLEM: I GET DISCONNECTED FROM A SERVER AFTER THE FIRST TIME LOADING IN, BUT ALWAYS GET IN THE SECOND TIME</P>
<P>This is most like caused by a setting on the server that defines how long it will wait to hear from a client before it disconnects them.  If the time it takes your machine to load the map is higher than this, the server will disconnect you.  As the second map load is likely far shorter, this is what allows you in the second time.  This setting is entirely under the control of the server administrator.</P>
<P>PROBLEM: I AM UNABLE TO JOIN A PASSWORD PROTECTED TEAM</P>
<P>Server administrators may password protect a team, however no prompt is given to enter a password when attempting to join the team.  In order to join, open the game console by holding down the CTRL+ALT keys, and pressing ~(TILDE).  Once the console is open, type 'g_gdfTeamPassword/g_stroggTeamPassword &lt;put password here&gt;' and press ENTER.</P>
<P>-=MISCELLANEOUS=-</P>
<P>PROBLEM: AFTER INSTALLING AND RUNNING THE LITE SERVER, MY FULL GAME REVERTED TO ENGLISH</P>
<P>If you have the full game installed in addition to the Lite Server, the full game may revert to English.  To solve the problem, follow these steps:</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Launch the game, and then open the console by holding down CTRL and ALT, then pressing ~(TILDE).<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Type the following in the console and press Enter:</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sys_lang &lt;language name&gt;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. The valid languages are Spanish, French, German, Russian, and Polish.  Note that these need to be typed in English.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. Then type this and press Enter:</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;reloadLanguage<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. Close the console with ~(TILDE) and the problem will be resolved.</P>
<P>To avoid this problem in the future, use the Server Launcher that is included with the full game as opposed to the Lite Server.</P>
<P>PROBLEM: WHEN I LAUNCH THE GAME, MY MOUSE CURSOR CONSTANTLY MOVES IN ONE DIRECTION</P>
<P>This problem is likely to occur if you have a joystick or game controller plugged into your computer.  Unplugging these should resolve the issue.</P>
<BR>
<HR>
<P>V. KNOWN ISSUES</P>
<HR>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>-ATI users may notice loss of brightness slider functionality when toggling between fullscreen and windowed mode.<BR>
-ATI Crossfire(tm) users may experience some rendering issues on some map objects such as buildings, etc. Disabling the Crossfire functionality will fix this issue.<BR>
-There have been some stability issues with the ATI Radeon HD 2400 video card.  Please ensure that you have the latest drivers from ATI installed before launching the game.</P>
