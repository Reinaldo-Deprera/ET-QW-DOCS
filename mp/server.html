				<h2>Starting a Server</h2>
				<P>&nbsp;</P>
				<P>First, you must decide how many players your server will be able to support.  This is largely determined by the Internet connection upstream of your server.  To determine the upstream of your Internet connection, please contact your Internet Service Provider.  Below is a list of some standard upstream values - your specific network setup and Internet connection may not exactly match the values on the list.  To the right of each respective upstream value is the maximum player limit that we suggest.  In order to limit the number of human player connections to your server, you must set your &quot;Max Players&quot; count in the Server Launcher.  Set this value to the number of players that most closely matches the upstream value of your server.</P>
				256Kbps: 8 players<BR>
				512Kbps: 13 players<BR>
				768Kbps: 17 players<BR>
				1.5Mbps: 24 players</P>
				<BR>
				<BR>
				<P>If you are on a connection that cannot support the number of human players you desire,  you can add bots to your server. Although you will not be able to add an unlimited number of bots, they don’t require the same amount of network overhead as human players.  As an example, if you have the minimum amount of bot players set at 16  (Bot Option/Minimum Clients) bots will automatically adjust their numbers to keep the total player count at 16.  Below is a guideline showing the maximum number of human players and bots that a limited Internet connection will support and still provide a good gameplay experience for players.</P>
				<P>Suggested Player to Bot maximum (Minimum Clients = 16, Maximum Players - determined by upstream value)</P>
				256Kbps: 4 players + 12 bots<BR>
				512Kbps: 10 players + 6 bots<BR>
				768Kbps: 13 players + 3 bots</P>
				<BR>
				<BR>
				<h3>Setup</h3>
				<BR>
				<P>Enemy Territory: QUAKE Wars comes with a server tool that will allow you to set all server variables, save server profiles, and then launch a server.  The installer will place a shortcut to this tool in your Start Menu.  Several options need to be set within the server tool before a server can be launched:</P>
				<ol class="decimal">
				<li>The server executable (etqwded.exe) needs to be selected.  From the second page in the server tool, the first option under Game Environment is 'Executable'.  Select this option, browse to the folder where ET:QW has been installed, and then select etqwded.exe.  The browse window should default to this location.</li>
				<li>A map rotation must be created.  On the first page, select the Rotation option.  In Campaign mode there are four campaigns to choose from; in StopWatch and Objective mode you can select each individual map.</li>
				<li>A profile must be created and saved.  From the File menu, select Save Profile As... and save the profile.</li>
				</ol>
				<P>These are the minimum options that need to be set prior to launching the server.  A full explanation of each option is below.</P>
				<h3>Options</h3>
				<h5>Server Properties</h5>
				<b><i>-SERVER NAME</b></i> - This text will show the server name as it will appear to other players in the game browser.<BR>

				<BR>
				<BR>
				<h3>Ports</h3>
				<BR>
				In order to host an Internet server, the following ports must be open on your firewall and/or router:</P>
				<P>Incoming:<BR>
				UDP: 27733<BR>
				UDP: 3074<BR>
				<P>The first is the game port, which can be changed by using net_port (default 27733). The other is the DemonWare one, which can be changed by net_sdnetPort (default 3074).</BR>
				<P>Besides that, outgoing TCP traffic should be allowed to:</BR>
				<P>etqw-auth.mmp3.demonware.net:3074</BR>
				<P>etqw-lsg.mmp3.demonware.net:3074</BR>
				<P>ET:QW doesn't support NAT traversal.  If you are hosting a server through a router, you will need to enable DMZ and/or configure your router's port forwarding.  Please see your router documentation for information on how to enable this.</P>
				<BR>
				<h3>Configuring Admin & Remote Console</h3>
				<BR>
				<h5>Configuring Admin</h5>
				In order to allow clients to have admin access to your server, you must configure the usergroups.dat file located in the /base folder of the server.  Open the file with a text editor such as notepad or wordpad.  The first and foremost thing that needs to be done is set the admin password as such:</P>
				<P>Find the line that appears as:</P>
				<P>   //&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;password&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PASSWORD</P>
				<P>Remove the '//', and specify the password you want where 'PASSWORD' appears above.</P>
				<P>Close as save the file, and then start your server.  Clients will then be able to use the specified password to access the in-game admin controls.</P>
				<h5>Configuring Remote Console(RCON)</h5>
				A feature of the ET:QW engine is the ability to send console commands and cvars to the server from a client.  A server must be set up with a password before this feature will work.  Launch a server, then type the following in the command line:</P>
				<P>   net_ServerRemoteConsolePassword &quot;PASSWORD&quot;</P>
				<P>Once set, connect to the server from a client and enter the following in the console (hold CTRL+ALT, then press ~(TILDE))</P>
				<P>   net_ClientRemoteConsolePassword &quot;PASSWORD&quot;</P>
				<P>Once this is set, precede all commands and cvars with 'rcon' to send it to the server, as such:</P>
				<P>   rcon si_rules &quot;sdGameRulesCampaign&quot;<BR>
				   rcon spawnserver<BR>
				<P>Note that when using rcon to query PunkBuster cvars, no feedback will be returned to the client console.<BR>
				<h3>Servers with multiple IP Addresses & Instances</h3>
				<BR>
				<P>If you intend to host servers on different IPs on the same machine, make note that the following must be set on each server under Additional Parameters:</P>
				<P>   +Net_IP &quot;&lt;IP of the server instance&gt;&quot;</P>
				<P>So it should look like:</P>
				<P>   +Net_IP &quot;192.168.0.100&quot;<BR>
				   <BR>
				Additionally if multiple servers are running on the same machine, separate ports must be specified for each instance using the net_port cvar:</P>
				<P>   +Net_port &quot;&lt;port number here&gt;&quot;</P>
				<BR>
				<h3>Unbanning users that were banned through admin</h3>
				<BR>
				<P>If a user is banned through the admin menu, the only way to remove their ban is by removing their entry from the guidstates.dat file.  This file can be edited with any simple text editor such as Notepad or Wordpad.  The guidstates.dat file is located here:</P>
				<P>   C:\Documents and Settings\&lt;YOUR WINDOWS ACCOUNT NAME&gt;\My Documents\id Software\Enemy Territory - QUAKE Wars\base</P>
				<P>Note that this is a hidden folder, so 'Show hidden files and folders' needs to be enabled in your View options.</P>
				<BR>
				<h3>Disabling proficiencies in the middle of a match</h3>
				<BR>
<P>If an admin or vote passes to disable proficiencies, any proficiencies gained by the player will remain until the map restarts.  It is recommended that the map be restarted after the change.
