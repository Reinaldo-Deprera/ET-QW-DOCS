				<h2>Quick Chat Menu</h2>
				<P> You can communicate with players using the Quick Chat Menu. Some messages will only be played to your teammates, while others (Global) will be played to all players on your server.</P>
				<P>You can choose in the Escape-Options-Game Settings-Advanced-Shortcuts menu whether you want to have your Quick Chat menu listed either alphabetically:<BR>
				 <BR>
				V-E-A &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Enemy Armor Spotted"<BR>

				V-C-M &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Move!"<BR>
				V-V-R&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I Need Repairs"</P>
				<P>or numerically:</P>
				<P>V-5-4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Enemy Armor Spotted"<BR>
				V-6-1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Move!"<BR>
				V-4-5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I Need Repairs"</P>

				<P>The Chats are divided up into the following categories: <BR>
				Global<BR>
				Responses<BR>
				Need<BR>
				Vehicles<BR>
				Enemy<BR>
				Commands<BR>
				Objectives<BR>
				Self</P>

				<P>It’s worth studying the Quick Chat menu layout so you can find what you want to say quickly.</P>

				<P><h3>Context-Sensitive</h3>
				The Context-Sensitive menu allows you to send vital warnings, request and alerts to your teammates extremely efficiently and rapidly, with only a keypress and mouseclick.  You will have different options available depending on what your crosshair is over.  You can customize the look and feel of the chat menus in the Options Menu.
				</p>
				<BR>
				<BR>
				<p>
				Note: Bots will only reply and attempt to perform your Context-Sensitive interface messages.
				</p>
				<p>
					<h3>Chat</h3>
					You can type text messages to other players. <b>T</b> key (default) will type to all players on the server. <b>Y</b> key (default) will type only to players on your team. <b>U</b> key (default) will type only to players on your Fireteam.
				</p>
				<br>
				<br>
					<h2>MISSIONS & FIRETEAMS</h2>
				<p>
					The Mission System continuously updates you on the most important, and most useful thing you could be doing for your team on the battlefield.  It then automatically queues up that mission, tells you where to go in the map, and how to complete it.  If you choose to do the mission, you will also gain an XP bonus in your class for doing so.  When playing, at any time, you can cycle through the available missions (default “M” key) and change the active mission you are on.  This information is then displayed on the scoreboard for other players, which you can check at any time to see what missions other players are currently undertaking.
				</p>
				<p>
					There are two types of teams you can join, the Fireteam and the Mission team.  Fireteams are created by players, and you can invite, rename and otherwise manage aspects of the team itself.  The other is the Mission team, which is a list of other people who are also doing the mission you have selected. Fireteams are actively managed by Fireteam leaders; Mission teams are managed by the game and your participation in them is automatic and passive. Mission teams have some, but not all of the benefits of a “proper” Fireteam. You’ll be rewarded with extra XP if your mission is successful no matter which type of team you have joined. In addition to completing Objectives and Missions, you also earn XP for staying alive, for taking damage, for dealing damage, killing enemy players and destroying or disabling enemy vehicles and deployables.
				</p>
				<p>
					The game creates a Mission Team of all other players that are on the same mission as you, as long as they are not already currently in a Fireteam, and once the mission is successful, all the players in the Mission Team will be rewarded with extra XP. ETQW automatically creates missions and includes you in Mission Teams with no additional input needed from you.
				</p>
				<p>
					You can also cycle through all the available missions (the M key by Default) and see what other missions are available to you.  Your mission team will be updated automatically based on what mission you have selected. Fireteams on the other hand are actively created and managed by a player, who can choose what missions they undertake. If you want to undertake additional missions and share XP upon their success, create or join a Fireteam. You can only be in a Mission Team or a Fireteam, not both at once.
				</p>
				<p>
					Fireteams assist and reward tactical coordination by giving you extra data on your fellow players and rewarding each member with a share in the XP for successfully completing objectives. Up to 8 players can be in a Fireteam. The player who creates a Fireteam becomes the Fireteam Leader. They can cycle through the list of missions available and choose a mission for the entire team with the M key (default). A difference between the passive Mission system and the Fireteam system is the Mission system only lets you accept missions suitable to your own class, but as a Fireteam Leader you can accept any mission on behalf of your entire Fireteam, as long as you have a player of that class in your Fireteam. This means the more classes in a Fireteam, the more mission options the team will have.
				</p>
				<p>
					As the mission is completed, the entire Fireteam gets shared XP in their appropriate class, regardless of the XP the mission gives.
				</p>
				<p>
					As an example, if the GDF Engineer accepts the default mission to construct the Guard Tower, he is rewarded with up to 10 Engineer XP for completing the Guard Tower and an extra 2 XP for having accepted the mission.
				</p>
				<p>
					If that same GDF Engineer was part of a Fireteam along with a Soldier and a Medic, and the Fireteam Leader accepts that mission for the entire Fireteam, then not only does the Engineer get 10 + 2 Engineer XP when he completes the Guard Tower construction, but the Soldier gets 2 Soldier XP and the Medic gets 2 Medic XP as well. If the Soldier and Medic hadn't been part of a Fireteam along with the Engineer, they wouldn't have received any XP for the Guard Tower construction.
				</p>
				<p>
					The XP reward for some missions, such as the GDF Engineer constructing a Guard Tower, is gradually shared out as the objective is completed.  Other missions, such as the Strogg Aggressor destroying a Guard Tower, get a Completion bonus only when fully complete, which is then spread out through the members of the Fireteam.
					Information provided to the Fireteam includes location (both waypoint and landmark description) as well as class, health and a separate chat channel to communicate in.
				</p>
				<h3>Fireteam Menu</h3>
					Use the Fireteam Menu to create and manage your Fireteam. The options include:<br>
				<b>	Invite</b> 	(invites player)<br>
				<b>	Kick </b>	(kicks player)<br>
				<b>	Disband	</b>(disbands Fireteam)<br>
				<b>	Leave </b>	(leave current Fireteam)<br>
				<b>	Promote	</b>(resign Leadership, make another player Fireteam Leader)<br>
				<b>	Make Private/Public	</b>(toggles between allowing anyone to join or invitees only)<br>
				<b>	Rename	</b>(rename Fireteam. Default names are Alpha, Beta etc.)
				</p>
				<p>
				<h3>Player-Created Missions</h3>
					You can create some missions for your teammates yourself by using the Context Menu (default V). Some of these player-generated missions will also reward the player completing them with bonus XP.
				</p>
				<p>
					For example, if one of your team’s deployables gets damaged or disabled, you can look at it, hit V to bring up your Context Menu and hit Fire to create a mission for a nearby Engineer, send them a “Repair that Deployable” message, place a waypoint in their HUD directing them to the deployable. They can then complete the mission by repairing the deployable.
