				<h2>GAME OBJECTIVE</h2>
				<p>
					Enemy Territory: QUAKE Wars is a fast paced game of skill and strategy as two teams: the Human Global Defense Force and the alien Strogg, both vie for control of the Earth. In every map, no matter what the game mode, one team is attacking, and one team is defending for the duration of that game. Some maps the Strogg are defending key locations, others, the GDF are trying to repel the Strogg.
				</p>
				<p>
					In <b>Objective Mode</b>, a match consists of a single game map representing one pivotal battle in the global conflict. Player Experience Points (XP) and Proficiency Awards are reset after each match. Each map is divided up into territories, with control of each territory centering on a key military objective.
				</p>
				<p>
					These objectives require the attacking team to perform a specific action (such as build a bridge, or destroy an obstacle) at a designated map location. If successful, they will take control of the territory, including any vehicle or Team Spawn Points it contains, and the defending team will be pushed back. Once an objective has been accomplished, it cannot be undone.
				</p>
				<p>
					Most Objectives can only be completed by a particular player class. You will need an Engineer to build a bridge for example, or an Infiltrator to hack security controls. These objectives must be completed in the order they appear. The attacking team will not be able to accomplish the second objective before the first has been finished.
				</p>
				<p>
					Depending on the battle selected, your team will be assigned to either attack, or defend. The attacking team must accomplish all of the key objectives in order to achieve victory. The defending team must delay the attackers, defending the objectives until the timelimit is reached to win the match.
				</p>
				<p>
					In <b>Campaign Mode</b>, three linked maps will be played representing a regional conflict, with the match awarded to the team that wins at least two of the three games. Player Experience Points (XP) and Proficiency Awards will not be reset until the end of the third game.
				</p>
				<p>
					In <b>Stopwatch Mode</b> teams play the same map twice, once defending, once attacking. The team defending in the first round will then try to beat the attacking team’s time in the second round. Teams win by completing the objectives in the shortest time.
				</p>
				<h3>MAPS:</h3>

				<p>
					The maps in the game are located all over the world and represent key battles and critical events that take place during the Strogg invasion of earth.  While most maps vary in environment and climate, there are some commonalities.
				</p>

				<h3>SPAWN POINTS:</h3>

				<p>
					Team Spawn Points will change automatically when objectives are completed and new territories are won. However, you may change your spawn location by clicking on any of the green flags on the map in the Limbo Menu. Some forward spawn points need to be captured in order to be useable by your team.  They also need to be defended, as they can be re-taken by the opposing forces.  The Strogg can also create spawn hosts from fallen GDF soldiers, this is explained in more detail in the classes section of this document.
				</p>
				<p>
					To capture a Forward Spawn aim your crosshair at it and hold down the Use Key (Default F)
				</p>

				<h3>OBJECTIVES:</h3>

				</p>
				<p>
					Depending on the team you choose, you will be trying to complete objectives or defending them. It is important to check your limbo menu for the current objective which will be indicated on the limbo map. Objectives are numbered and must be completed in a specific order.  Many objectives can only be completed by a certain class.
				</p>
				<p>
					For example, only GDF Engineers and Strogg Constructors can construct objects like bridges.
				</p>
				<p>	Once an objective is completed, the next territory will be won, and your team will advance. The territory you have taken over cannot be reclaimed by the defending team and the territory you start with cannot be lost.  Once an objective is completed, High command (GDF) or the Nexus (Strogg) will describe what the next critical objective is, and how to achieve it.
