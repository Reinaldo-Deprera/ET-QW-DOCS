				<h2>General Weapon Info</h2>
				<p>Your stance affects your weapons accuracy. Crouching (Default C) will reduce your target area and give you better aim, but slows your movement. Going Prone (Default X) will give you the best accuracy of all, and will make you a much smaller target, but it takes time to switch between prone and standing positions, and only allows you to crawl. You’ll get the best accuracy by firing short bursts, or even better, single shots.</P>

				<P>Equipping a heavy weapon slows your run speed. Change to a lighter weapon to run faster.</P>
				<P>Firing your weapon for too long will cause it to overheat. The weapon must cool down before you can fire again.</P>
				<P>Sight view provides better accuracy, but reduced movement speed. You cannot Sprint in Weapon Sight view.</P>
				<br>

				<img src="_m/weapons/spikes.jpg" class="weapon left" />
				<P><b>Spikes</b><BR>
				All Strogg players are implanted with combat Spikes during the 				Stroggification process. Use the Spikes for silent melee kills. You'll do extra Backstab damage from behind.</P>
				<br>

				<img src="_m/weapons/blaster.jpg" class="weapon left" />
				<P><b>Blaster</b><BR>
				The Blaster is your short-range backup weapon.  It is the standard Strogg personal defence sidearm. It fires bolts of hot plasma, scorching and melting its target. The Blaster gets very hot, which limits its rate of fire.</P>
				<br>

				<img src="_m/weapons/lightning.jpg" class="weapon left" />
				<P><b>Lightning Pistol</b><BR>
				The Lightning Pistol is your electrifying short-range backup weapon. It is made available to select Strogg players as a personal defence sidearm. It discharges shocking arcs of electrical energy at the target. The Lightning Pistol fires in a constant stream, making it easy to keep it on target even while <img src="_m/weapons/black1.jpg" class="black1 left" />moving.</P>
				<br>

				<img src="_m/weapons/lacerator.jpg" class="weapon left" />
				<P><b>Lacerator</b><BR>
				The Lacerator is a good short/medium-range infantry weapon. Fire short bursts for greater accuracy. Experienced Constructors can earn the Plasma Launcher attachment upgrade.</P>
				<br>

				<img src="_m/weapons/obliterator.jpg" class="weapon left" />
				<P><b>Obliterator</b><BR>
				More effective against vehicles and deployables than infantry, the Obliterator has two modes, Dumb and Smart. In Dumb mode, it fires an unguided Strocket, like a bazooka. There is a slight delay before firing, and the unguided Strocket has an arced trajectory, requiring the player to correct their <img src="_m/weapons/black2.jpg" class="black2 left" />aim depending on the target’s range.</P>

				<P>Hitting Alt-Fire enters Smart Mode, which uses the electronic sight to Lock On to enemy vehicles and deployables. Track the enemy unit until the crosshair <img src="_m/weapons/black1.jpg" class="black1 left" />turns from green to red and then hit fire. The Obliterator’s Strocket will then guide itself to the target, without any further need for you to track it. Hit Use to <img src="_m/weapons/black1.jpg" class="black1 left" />cancel Lock On.</P>
				<br>

				<img src="_m/weapons/hyperblaster.jpg" class="weapon left" />
				<P><b>Hyperblaster</b><BR>
				The Hyperblaster is the Strogg’s main anti-infantry support weapon, firing gobs of plasma. It is more effective against infantry than vehicles. The Hyperblaster takes some time to spin its barrels up to full speed, so it will not do full damage until it is warmed up.  It is much more accurate fired from the <img src="_m/weapons/black1.jpg" class="black1 left" />Prone position.</P>
				<br>

				<img src="_m/weapons/nailgun.jpg" class="weapon left" />
				<P><b>Nailgun</b><BR>
				The Nailgun is very effective at short range but ineffective at distance. It’s extremely useful for fighting indoors.</P>
				<br>
				<br>

				<img src="_m/weapons/lacerator_plasma.jpg" class="weapon left" />
				<P><b>Plasma Launcher</b><BR>
				The Plasma Launcher is useful for firing over cover, through doorways and windows and is effective against infantry, deployables and vehicles. The plasma blobs will bounce off surfaces, allowing you to shoot around corners. The arc of the Plasma Launcher comes in handy to damage deployables from <img src="_m/weapons/black1.jpg" class="black1 left" />behind cover and from quite a range. Careful you don’t fire from too close, or they may bounce back at you.</P>
				<br>

				<img src="_m/weapons/railgun.jpg" class="weapon left" />
				<P><b>Railgun</b><BR>
				The Railgun is your long range killing tool. It has to charge back up to full power before it will do maximum damage again. The Railgun has zoomable sights. Press Alt-Fire (Mouse2 default) for Weapon Sight view and then scroll your mousewheel or hit <b>F</b> to cycle through the levels of zoom magnification. </P></P>
				<br>

				<img src="_m/weapons/accurised_lacerator.jpg" class="weapon left" />
				<P><b>Accurized Lacerator</b><BR>
				The Accurized Lacerator is a good short/medium-range infantry weapon and is the sharpshooter adaption of the standard infantry weapon. In Alt-Fire Weapon Sight mode it will fire only three-round bursts for better accuracy.</P>
				<br>

				<img src="_m/weapons/shrap_grenade.jpg" class="weapon left" />
				<P><b>Shrap Grenade</b><BR>
				The Shrap Grenade is the standard Strogg tactical explosive device. It is effective against GDF infantry, deployables and vehicles.  By using alt-fire, it will act as a sticky grenade</P>
				<br>
				<br>

				<img src="_m/weapons/scrambler_grenade.jpg" class="weapon left" />
				<P><b>Scrambler Grenade</b><BR>
				The Scrambler grenade is used by the Strogg Infiltrator class to disable GDF vehicles and deployables. It is particularly useful for knocking out enemy defence turrets, creating a window of opportunity for attacking players to swarm past without harm.</P>
